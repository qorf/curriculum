//We need the DataFrame class to load in files for Data Science operations.
use Libraries.Compute.Statistics.DataFrame

//Create a DataFrame, which is essentially a table that understands 
//more information about the data that is being loaded.
//Using the default loader is enough for our purposes
DataFrame frame

//Tell the frame we want the first column selected
